# Kaggle Competitions Overview 

## Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge
Develop models to predict the next 14 days of sales for each warehouse inventory item using historical sales data. The datasets provided include:

sales_train.csv & sales_test.csv: Contain inventory IDs, dates, warehouse names, total orders, sell price, availability, and discount features. The target variable is the sales column in the training set. <br><br>
inventory.csv: Provides additional inventory details. <br><br>
calendar.csv: Contains dates with holiday and warehouse event indicators. <br><br>
The objective is to forecast the sales column for each unique inventory-date combination. <br><br>


## Spaceship Titanic Dimension Transport Challenge

Dataset Overview:

train.csv: Contains records for roughly 8,700 passengers including features such as PassengerID, HomePlanet, CryoSleep, Cabin, Destination, Age, VIP status, and spending at various amenities. The target variable is Transported (True/False).
test.csv: Contains records for about 4,300 passengers for which predictions are required.
sample_submission.csv: Provides the correct submission format.
